     HOW TO CREATE YOUR TESSITURAGRAM FILES — A BEGINNER'S GUIDE
================================================================================

This guide will walk you through every step needed to run this project and
generate tessituragram data from MusicXML (.mxl) files. No prior coding
experience is required.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project takes sheet music files (in MusicXML/.mxl format) and analyzes the
vocal line to produce a "tessituragram" — a breakdown of how long the singer
spends on each pitch. The output is saved as a JSON file you can use for
further analysis or visualization.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU WILL NEED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
2. An internet connection (to download Python and the required library)
3. MusicXML files (.mxl format) of the songs you want to analyze
   - The project already includes 101 sample .mxl files in the
     "songs/mxl_songs" folder (works by Clara Schumann, Robert Schumann,
     Franz Schubert, Claude Debussy, and Gabriel Fauré)


================================================================================
STEP 1: INSTALL PYTHON
================================================================================

Python is the programming language this project is written in. You need to
install it before you can run anything.

  FOR WINDOWS:
  1. Open your web browser and go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  2. Click the big yellow "Download Python" button (version 3.10 or newer).
  3. Run the installer that downloads.
  4. IMPORTANT: On the first screen of the installer, check the box that says
     "Add Python to PATH" (at the bottom of the window). This is critical!
  5. Click "Install Now" and wait for it to finish.
  6. Click "Close" when done.

  FOR MAC:
  1. Open your web browser and go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  2. Click the big yellow "Download Python" button (version 3.10 or newer).
  3. Open the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installer prompts.
  4. Click through each step and finish the installation.

  TO VERIFY PYTHON IS INSTALLED:
  1. Open a terminal:
     - Windows: Press the Windows key, type "cmd", and press Enter.
       (Or search for "PowerShell" and open it.)
     - Mac: Press Cmd + Space, type "Terminal", and press Enter.
  2. Type the following and press Enter:

         python --version

     You should see something like "Python 3.12.1" (the exact number may
     differ). If you see an error, try:

         python3 --version

     If that works, use "python3" instead of "python" for all later steps.


================================================================================
STEP 2: DOWNLOAD OR LOCATE THE PROJECT
================================================================================

If you already have the project folder on your computer (for example, you
downloaded it from GitHub or someone shared it with you), skip ahead.

  IF YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT FROM GITHUB:
  1. Go to the GitHub page for this project in your web browser.
  2. Click the green "Code" button.
  3. Click "Download ZIP".
  4. Find the downloaded ZIP file (usually in your Downloads folder).
  5. Right-click it and choose "Extract All..." (Windows) or double-click it
     (Mac) to unzip it.
  6. You should now have a folder called something like
     "tessituragram-based_rep_recs" (or similar).

Remember where this folder is — you will need the path to it in the next step.


================================================================================
STEP 3: OPEN A TERMINAL IN THE PROJECT FOLDER
================================================================================

You need to navigate your terminal to the project folder so the commands you
run can find the project files.

  FOR WINDOWS:
  1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the project folder.
  2. Click in the address bar at the top (where it shows the folder path).
  3. Type "cmd" or "powershell" and press Enter.
     A terminal window will open, already pointed at the project folder.

  ALTERNATIVE (any OS):
  1. Open a terminal (see Step 1 for how).
  2. Type "cd " (with a space after it), then type or paste the path to the
     project folder. For example:

         cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\tessituragram-based_rep_recs

     On Mac, it might look like:

         cd /Users/YourName/Desktop/tessituragram-based_rep_recs

  3. Press Enter.

  TO VERIFY YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT FOLDER:
  - Windows: Type "dir" and press Enter. You should see files like
    "requirements.txt", "README.md", and a "src" folder listed.
  - Mac/Linux: Type "ls" and press Enter. You should see the same files.


================================================================================
STEP 4: INSTALL THE REQUIRED LIBRARY
================================================================================

This project depends on a library called "music21" which knows how to read
sheet music files. You need to install it once.

  In your terminal (which should be in the project folder), type:

      pip install -r requirements.txt

  and press Enter.

  If that gives an error, try:

      pip3 install -r requirements.txt

  This will download and install "music21" and everything it needs.
  It may take a minute or two. You will see text scrolling — that is normal.

  When it is done, you should see a message like "Successfully installed...".

  NOTE: You only need to do this step once. The library stays installed on
  your computer for future use.


================================================================================
STEP 5: ADD YOUR MusicXML FILES (OPTIONAL)
================================================================================

The project already comes with 101 sample .mxl files in the "songs/mxl_songs"
folder. If you want to analyze your own songs, follow these steps. Otherwise,
skip to Step 6.

  1. Open the project folder in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).
  2. Open the "songs/mxl_songs" folder inside it.
  3. Copy or move your .mxl files into this folder.

  FILE NAMING CONVENTION (RECOMMENDED):
  For the best automatic metadata extraction (composer name and song title),
  name your files using this pattern:

      lastname-firstname-collection-op{number}-no{number}-title.mxl

  Examples:
      schumann-clara-6-lieder-op13-no1-ich-stand-in-dunklen-traumen.mxl
      hensel-fanny-mendelssohn-6-lieder-op7-no3-fruhling.mxl

  If your files do not follow this pattern, the program will still work — it
  will try to read metadata from inside the MusicXML file itself, or fall back
  to using the filename as the title.


================================================================================
STEP 6: RUN THE PROGRAM
================================================================================

Now you are ready to generate your tessituragrams!

  In your terminal (still in the project folder), type:

      python -m src.main

  and press Enter.

  If "python" does not work, try:

      python3 -m src.main

  WHAT YOU WILL SEE:
  The program will print output like this:

      Found 101 .mxl file(s)

      Processing: debussy-claude-3-chansons-de-france-no1-rondel-le-temps-a-laisse-son-manteau.mxl
      Processing: faure-gabriel-cinq-melodies-op58-no1-mandoline.mxl
      Processing: schubert-franz-die-schone-mullerin-d795-no1-das-wandern.mxl
      ...
      Saving 101 tessituragram(s) to data\tessituragrams.json
      Done!

  This may take a few minutes depending on how many files you have and how
  fast your computer is. Each file takes a few seconds to process.


================================================================================
STEP 7: FIND YOUR OUTPUT
================================================================================

Once the program finishes, your results are saved in:

    data/tessituragrams.json

  (Inside the project folder, in a subfolder called "data".)

  This is a JSON file. You can open it with:
  - Any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code, etc.)
  - A JSON viewer website (search "JSON viewer online")
  - Another program or script that reads JSON data

  WHAT IS IN THE OUTPUT:
  The JSON file contains an array of songs. Each song includes:

    - "composer"       : The composer's name (e.g., "Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel")
    - "title"          : The song title (e.g., "Op. 7 No. 1 Nachtwanderer")
    - "filename"       : The original .mxl filename
    - "tessituragram"  : A list of every pitch the singer sings and how long
                         they spend on it (measured in quarter-note beats).
                         Each pitch is keyed by its MIDI note number (e.g.,
                         "60" for middle C, "66" for F#4/Gb4). Using MIDI
                         numbers ensures that enharmonic equivalents (notes
                         that sound the same but are spelled differently,
                         like F# and Gb) are always treated as the same
                         pitch, making comparisons across songs consistent.
    - "statistics"     : Summary info including:
        - "total_duration" : Total duration of all notes and rests
        - "pitch_range"    : The lowest and highest notes sung, given as
                             both a standard note name (e.g., "C4") and a
                             MIDI number (e.g., 60)
        - "unique_pitches" : How many different pitches appear


================================================================================
ADVANCED OPTIONS
================================================================================

The program accepts optional arguments if you want to customize its behavior.

  PROCESS A SINGLE FILE:
  Instead of processing all files in songs/mxl_songs, you can process just one:

      python -m src.main --file songs/mxl_songs/schumann-clara-6-lieder-op13-no1-ich-stand-in-dunklen-traumen.mxl

  USE A DIFFERENT INPUT FOLDER:
  If your .mxl files are in a different folder:

      python -m src.main --input-dir path/to/your/folder

  SAVE OUTPUT TO A DIFFERENT FILE:
  If you want the results saved somewhere else:

      python -m src.main --output my_results.json

  COMBINE OPTIONS:
  You can combine any of these:

      python -m src.main --input-dir my_songs --output results/output.json


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

  PROBLEM: "python is not recognized" or "command not found"
  SOLUTION: Python is not installed or not in your PATH.
  - Reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH".
  - Try using "python3" instead of "python".

  PROBLEM: "pip is not recognized" or "command not found"
  SOLUTION: Try "pip3" instead of "pip", or run:
      python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

  PROBLEM: "No module named src" or "ModuleNotFoundError"
  SOLUTION: Make sure your terminal is in the project's root folder (the one
  that contains the "src" folder and "requirements.txt"), not inside the
  "src" folder itself.

  PROBLEM: "No .mxl files found"
  SOLUTION: Make sure your MusicXML files have the .mxl extension and are
  inside the "songs/mxl_songs" folder (or whichever folder you specified
  with --input-dir).

  PROBLEM: "Error processing [filename]: ..."
  SOLUTION: The .mxl file may be corrupted or in an unsupported format.
  Try opening it in a music notation program (like MuseScore) and
  re-exporting it as .mxl.

  PROBLEM: The program is very slow
  SOLUTION: This is normal for large or complex scores. Each file may take
  several seconds. The music21 library does a lot of work behind the scenes
  to parse the music.


================================================================================
SUMMARY OF COMMANDS
================================================================================

  Here is every command you need, in order:

  1. python --version                     (verify Python is installed)
  2. cd path/to/project/folder            (navigate to the project)
  3. pip install -r requirements.txt      (install dependencies — once only)
  4. python -m src.main                   (run the program)

  Your output will be at: data/tessituragrams.json
